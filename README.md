# UMN Rate My Professor Chrome Extension
 Rate my professor chrome extension for University of Minnesota Twin Cities.
 
 Loads ratings and reviews for professors right on the schedule builder:
 No more flipping back and forth and searching manually!
 
 
 p.s. I really dislike UI design so I apologize in advance.
 
To install:

* Go to chrome://extensions
* Now, Enable developer mode
* Click on Load Unpacked and the unzipped, file folder.
* The extension will now be installed

Note: You must use the folder in which the manifest.json exists.
